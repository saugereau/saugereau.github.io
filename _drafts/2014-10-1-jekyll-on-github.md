##Some jekyll bootstrap

- [JekyllBootStrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)
- [Octopress] (http://octopress.org/)

##Use of plugins
Jekkyl allow only few plugins : https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages
GitHub pages doesn't support custom Jekyll plugins as of yet
If you need to generate categories pages with plugin as you can see in [jekyllrb plugin documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#generators), it will be work on your localhost but not on github.
