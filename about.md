## Sebastien Augereau


I am a software engineer from more than 10 years, meanly on open source and java technology.
I live in Bordeaux, France and I worked mainly in IT Services & Software Engineering companies in the banking, energy and e-commerce and currently I work for Cdiscount.

I always liked learning new things, and I follow regularly some MOOC on coursera.

At first, I started this blog to bring a dish all notes that I have written on different file, and I think later that it could be useful too for other people.
So I'm not a specialist of web design (I'am still working on it), and this blog design is quite simple and uncluttered.

I'am currently working on this technology, so the blog content could be reflect this topics :

- Java and JEE
- Scala
- Cassandra
- Kafka
- MongoDb
- Play Framework
